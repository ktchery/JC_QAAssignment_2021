Here are a few notes, assumptions and findings from my testing of JumpCloud_ QA Assignment 2021

Questions for Product:

Are null or blank passwords still encrypted? 

Since we are encryptingÂ password shouldn't we use https instead of http?

Assumptions

Null or blank passwords are not to be encrypted

Outliers:

I am not sure how to confirm SHA512 so as per my notes in my test plan I tested the best way I interpreted it

The requirements for the get Stats call does not specify the conversion for Average Time, so although it is built into the automation suite as time > 5, it will always pass as in example 35656565 > 5.  The API request I am referring to is noted below

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/stats
